# Psilly

Psilly provides a path to what’s growing all around us: a “gold standard” of plant-powered, psychedelic therapy. Rather than compete over ownership of a natural compound, Psilly offers a delivery system, therapeutic framework, educational platform, and community that will ensure that people experience the value that psychedelic mushrooms have to offer for as accessible a cost as possible - $1 per dose.
